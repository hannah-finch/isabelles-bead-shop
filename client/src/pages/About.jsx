          <h2>How I Got Started</h2>
          <p>
          I have always loved making jewelry, but I don&apos;t really like to wear it. So I just had a bunch of jewelry and didn&apos;t know what to do with it. One day I had an idea, and that idea was to give it to people, and then my mom said that I should sell it. So I decided to sell it to people, but not penguins.
